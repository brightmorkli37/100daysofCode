### Note:

The structure ```client.chat.completions.create()``` is being used because I used a custom Azure OpenAI service instead of the regular OpenAI service. In most situations, you may not have a custom Azure OpenAI service so refer to the ```OpenAI Library for Python```: https://github.com/openai/openai-python
